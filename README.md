A fiesta of fun! :)

CommunicationSender and CommunicationReceiver will be the programs that are run by the server RPi. The sender file will send weather information such as units and location as well as various alarm times that will be stored in a database. CommunicationReceiver will receive the alarm signal from the secondary RPi. This signal will trigger a response in a program not yet created to signal the arduino to sound an alarm and turn a motor. The basicdatabase is the beginning of the database we will create to hold our alarm times.
